====== watchtower ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "watchtower" refers to a tall structure built as a place from which guards could look out for any danger.

  * Landowners built stone towers to protect their crops from being stolen. The towers often included rooms for living in so that the watchmen could live there and guard the crops day and night.
  * Cities that were surrounded by walls would have watchtowers built higher than the walls so that watchmen could see if any enemies were coming to attack the city.
