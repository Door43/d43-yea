The term "circumcise" means to cut off the foreskin of a man or male child. A circumcision ceremony may be performed in connection with this.

  * God also commanded Abraham's descendants to continue to do this for every baby boy born into their households.
  * The phrase, "circumcision of the heart" refers figuratively to the "cutting away" or removal of sin from a person.
  * In a spiritual sense, "the circumcised" refers to people whom God has purified from sin through the blood of Jesus and who are his people.
  * The term "uncircumcised" refers to those who have not been circumcised physically. It can also refer figuratively to those who have not been circumcised spiritually, who do not have a relationship with God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If the culture of the target language performs circumcisions on males, the word used to refer to this should be used for this term.
  * Other ways to translate this term would be, "cut around" or "cut in a circle" or "cut off the foreskin."
  * Make sure the term used to translate this does not refer to females. It may be necessary to translate this with a word or phrase that includes the meaning of "male."
